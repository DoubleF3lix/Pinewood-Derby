To start the event:

- Enter your list of racers in backend\racer_list.txt
- Copy this same list to web_interface\scripts\elimination_check.js, formatting it properly
- Delete any DB files in backend, and create a new file named "INIT"
- Start both instances of OBS
- Start the backend by opening a terminal in backend, activating the venv, and running main.py
- Supply power to the timer board, which will also activate the access point.
- Connect all the emcee iPad, the controller iPad, and the laptop to this access point.
- Supply power to the motor board
- If necessary, use the /change-ip endpoint on both the timer board and the motor board to point them to the backend URL. See the API Spec for more info.
- If necessary, edit the server URL at the top of web_interface\scripts\main.js
- Start the web server by opening a terminal in web_interface and run start.bat
- Load the Check Elimination panel on the laptop, the Emcee panel on the emcee's iPad, and the Control panel on the controller's iPad
- Perform a quick test run of the timer board and motor panel by using the various controls
- Start the stream
- Press "New Round" on the Control panel when you're ready, and switch the scene to Advanced Camera

If the backend crashes during the event, it should recover. If it does not, good luck.
